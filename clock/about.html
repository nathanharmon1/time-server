            <h1>About the Campanile Time Server</h1>

            <!-- Abstract -->
            <p>The Campanile Time Server was created as a way to create a high-reliability,
            accurate time source for the James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research
            Facility at Valparaiso University. Prior methods were not consistent
            or reliable enough for research use and for proper function of the facility.
            This project seeks to fix that by designing a software suite that leverages
            existing time information in a form compatible with the operational
            considerations of the facility. This software utilizes Go and Python,
            in files that connect to produce informative outputs on a display. These
            languages were chosen for their superior library support in web and
            GPIO interfacing. The project requirements necessitated a suitably robust
            case containing multiple Raspberry Pis that can interface with the software
            suite and provide failover redundancy. The group chose Raspberry Pis
            due to the global supply chain limiting hardware options. Additionally,
            other products did not have the variety of hardware accessories. The
            software components include a conversion script from clock time to solar
            time, scripts to parse data from the hardware devices, and a basic website
            to display time in the facility. The program files were complemented with
            unit test files to ensure valid results and continuous integration using
            Jenkins. The project proceeded with an Agile Development Method, as the
            team met regularly with their customer to discuss progress and receive feedback.</p>
